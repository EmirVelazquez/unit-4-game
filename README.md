Rupee Collector Game

 Here's how the app works:

   * There will be four rupee's displayed as buttons on the page.

   * The user will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

   * When the user clicks on a rupee, it will add a specific amount of points to the user's total score. 

   * The user wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

   * The user loses if their score goes above the random number.

   * The game restarts whenever the user wins or loses.
